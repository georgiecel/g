Build for my personal portfolio, [georgieluhur.com](http://georgieluhur.com). Launched 10 Oct 2015, built to update the old design and maintain consistent branding with [Hey Georgie](http://hey.georgie.nu). At present I would still consider it MVP. ;)

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) with [BEM](http://bem.info) naming convention, and following a modular file structure based on [SMACSS](http://smacss.com).

Browser support is IE9+. Still viewable in IE8, just not optimised.

Email **g @ my first name dot nu** if you have any suggestions for improvement.
